  <h2>Step 1: Know your target Job Description</h2>

  <p>
   Please make sure that you understand what a job description is.
   And, please make sure that you have read a number of target job descriptions
   by this time.

  <h4>some title if needed</h4>
  <p>Remember! Job descriptions are not always written by the technical people,
   as a result they can be confusing sometimes. And, it's a common scenario
   in tech jobs.
